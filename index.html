<h2>Hi I am Saptarshi Saha .</h2>
 <p> I leant how to use html properly  when i was in high school and now i feel that it would have been so much easier 
    to make all the school projects and other things to achieve if i knew this html earlier .
 </p>
 <h3>Some the problem i faced during my high school during doing my projects .</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Not being able to create my page according to my choice.</li>
    <li> Often ending up making a page that does not look like a real life page and peice of regular text.</li>
    <li> Not beimg able to work properly with all the text , and other necessary elelemts like ...</li>
   <ul>
       <li>Setting images properly .</li>
       <li>Mistakes in maintaing paragraphs ,</li>
       <li>Adjusting proper sixe of elements and etc...</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>A common problem i found is  about finding a lot of texts for practicing html </p>
<p>Fot that o found a helpful place from where we can get as much texts as we need in a any language
    and number of words we need , now chatgpt might also help but i found some mkstakes in it 
    while generating texts such as :
    <ol>
        <li>Not mainting no of words .</li>
        <li> Wrong number of paragraphs amd etc ...</li>
    </ol>
    So i prefer this website to find proper and more accurate kinf of texts for practicing
    <br/>
    <ul>
       <li><a href=" https://lipsum.com/" >  Lorem Ipsum</a></li> 
       <li>  <a href="https://www.broipsum.com/" > Bro Ipsum </a></li>
    </ul>
    If we want pictues of various types to practice for manupulaitng in the your website we can get 
    pictures from 
    <ul> 
        <li><a href="https://picsum.photos"> Lorem Picsum </a> </li>

    </ul>
